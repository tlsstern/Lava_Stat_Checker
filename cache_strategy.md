# Better Solution for Render Deployment (Without Expensive APIs)

Since scraping APIs are too expensive (500 requests = ~1 day), here's a better approach:

## Current Situation
- Render's IPs are blocked by bwstats.shivam.pro
- Scraping APIs are too expensive for regular use
- We have Supabase for caching

## The Community Cache Solution

### How It Works:

1. **Local Development Feeds the Cache**
   - When YOU run the app locally, it can fetch fresh data
   - This data gets saved to Supabase
   - The Render deployment uses this cached data

2. **Shared Cache Benefits**
   - Multiple users searching for the same player use cached data
   - Popular players stay fresh in cache
   - Less popular players can be updated periodically

3. **Cache Duration Strategy**
   - On Render: Accept cache up to 24 hours old
   - Locally: Normal 15-minute cache
   - This means data updates when someone runs locally

## Implementation Steps:

### 1. Run a Local Update Script
Create a simple script to update popular players:

```python
# update_cache.py
import scrapper
import time

popular_players = [
    'Technoblade', 'Dream', 'Gamerboy80', 'Purpled',
    'Hannahxxrose', 'Wallibear', 'gqtor', 'chazm',
    # Add more players your community searches for
]

for player in popular_players:
    print(f"Updating {player}...")
    scrapper.scrape_bwstats(player)
    time.sleep(2)  # Be nice to the server

print("Cache updated!")
```

Run this locally once or twice a day.

### 2. Alternative Deployments

Consider deploying to platforms with different IPs:

#### Vercel (Free)
- Different IP range than Render
- Might not be blocked
- Easy Flask deployment

#### Railway (Free tier)
- Different infrastructure
- $5 credit monthly
- Good Flask support

#### Fly.io (Free tier)
- Global edge network
- Different IPs per region
- Generous free tier

### 3. Hybrid Approach

1. **Primary**: Deploy on Vercel/Railway for fresh data
2. **Backup**: Keep Render deployment using cache
3. **Local**: Run update script periodically

### 4. Community Contribution

If you have a Discord/community:
- Share the local update script
- Have different people run it at different times
- Keeps cache fresh for everyone

## Quick Fix for Now:

1. **Increase cache acceptance on Render to 24 hours**
2. **Run locally once a day to update popular players**
3. **Consider moving to Vercel/Railway**

## Long-term Solutions:

1. **Contact bwstats.shivam.pro**
   - Explain your project
   - Ask for API access or unblock Render IPs
   - Offer to limit request rate

2. **Build Your Own Stats Cache**
   - Use Hypixel API when possible
   - Cache in your own database
   - Serve from your cache

3. **Crowd-source Updates**
   - Let users with working IPs contribute
   - Build a simple submission system
   - Verify and cache submissions
